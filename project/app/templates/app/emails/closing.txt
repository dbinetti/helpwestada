This will be the first -- and last -- update for the Help West Ada project.

As you may recall, I set up the Help West Ada website in response to the
District's anticipated need for substitute teachers following the move to
full-time, in-person K-12 instruction.  And you responded to this call, signing
up to volunteer immediately -- thank you so much!

However, apparently the situation has stabilized and there is no particular need
for a parent-specific initiative at this time.  Accordingly, I'll be shuttering
this site, effective immediately.   While your involvement wasn't needed in this
particular project, I'm confident in speaking for the District when I say "thank
you for being willing to step up!"  If you wish to serve as a substitute teacher
regardless, please find additional information here:

As promised, as part of the shut down your account will be permanently deleted,
along with your name, email, and any other personal information collected.  If
you'd like to reach me for any reason, please don't hesitate to call or text at
415.713.2126.

Thank you again for all you do for our kids!


Best, Dave
