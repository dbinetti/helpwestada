Thank you for participating in the Help West Ada project!

As you know, earlier this year West Ada experienced a critical need
for substitutes, and you answered the call by participating in our
Beta test for volunteer subs.  Since then, the HWA approach has been
formally incorporated into the Administration.  As such, there is no
longer a need for this website, and we'll be shutting it down
accordingly.

If you have any questions about being a volunteer substitute, please
reach out to Cheryl Botkin, the West Ada Substitute Placement
Administrator, at Botkin.Cheryl@westada.org.  She'll be able to
answer any of your questions moving forward.

As promised, as part of the shut down your account will be permanently
deleted, along with your name, email, and any other personal
information collected.  This will be the last email you receive.  If
you'd like to reach me for any reason, please don't hesitate to call
or text at 208.713.4599 or by email at dbinetti@gmail.com.

Thank you again for stepping up!


Best, Dave
