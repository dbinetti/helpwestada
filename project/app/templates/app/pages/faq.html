      <h5>
        What are you doing with my personal information?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        The data collected by the site is used to connect you to needed roles within the West Ada District, including as substitutes, para-educators, and any other position where help is needed.  If you specifically ask, we will share your data with the West Ada School District itself.  We do not share any information without your express permission.

      <h5>
        What is the process?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        We batch-process individual volunteers, and then schedule a time to be fingerprinted by the District Office (this is a legal requirement for all who enter a classroom in a teaching capacity.)  Then, you'll participate in a roughly two-hour online session to learn the basis of managing a classroom.  You'll also receive training related to school security procedures.  Finally, you'll attend a single training session in a classroom to get familiar with substituting in class.  After that, you'll be ready to substitute should the need arise!

      <h5>
        Do I get paid for this?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        No.  This program is specifically designed for those who wish to serve in a volunteer role on a "last resort" basis.  The District maintains a paid substitute program that you can review <a href='https://www.westada.org/SubstituteInfo'>here</a>.  Paid substitutes receive $80 per day, and they will be the first called to fill roles.

      <h5>
        Why the volunteer role if you can get paid?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        The paid substitute program requires additional forms, training, tax reporting and enrollment processes, and must be done in person at the District office.  It is designed for those who wish to pursue a career in education.  The Help West Ada program is focused on parents and patrons who are not seeking to enter the teaching profession, but are simply interested in helping the District on an as-needed basis when professional substitutes are not available.  Approaching this as a volunteer program makes for a lightweight, streamlined onboarding process that the paid program does not.

      <h5>
        How often will I be called to volunteer?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        It is difficult to estimate this, as we've never done the volunteer program before.  It is entirely possible you will never be called.  However, the important thing is that with sufficient participation the District will not need to close classrooms due to lack of available substitutes.

      <h5>
        Will I need to pay for anything?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        The District will pay for the required fingerprinting and background checks; we do not anticipate participants will have any out-of-pocket costs.

      <h5>
        Do I get to pick the schools where I volunteer?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        Yes, you can indicate your preferences either by school, geographic region, or District-wide.  Schedulers will work with you to ensure any assignments are as convenient as possible.

      <h5>
        What is the experience like in the classroom?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        While the program is new, substitutes in general report that the process is easy, straightforward, and a fun experience!  As part of the onboarding you will pair up with a current teacher or substitute in class for a training session to see for yourself what the teaching experience is like.

      <h5>
        How secure is this site?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        We use 128-bit SSL encryption on all transactions and all security patches are updated automatically.

      <h5>
        Who is paying for this?
      </h5>
      <p class='pl-4 col-lg-8'>
        This is entirely self-funded.  It isn't a business, and we're not even asking for donations.  We just want to keep the kids all in school, and that's worth more to us than the few dollars it takes to run this website.
